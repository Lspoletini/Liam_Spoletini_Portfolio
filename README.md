## Project 1: Wine Quality [[Repo link]](https://github.com/Lspoletini/WineHearts)
Final Project Submission for Statistical Machine Learning (STAT 627) at American University   
[**PDF of Report**](https://github.com/Lspoletini/WineHearts/blob/main/R/WineQuality.pdf)  
[**RMarkdown File**](https://github.com/Lspoletini/WineHearts/blob/main/R/WineQuality.Rmd)    

### Description
- Compared ordinal logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression, and linear regression for predicting wine quality with a dataset of chemical indicators.
- Reduced dimensionality using Principal Components, tuned via cross-validation with different cost functions.
- Language: R
- Packages: tidyverse, ggplot, glmnet, e1071, nnet, etc.
- Skills: regression, parameter tuning, dimensionality reduction

#### Description
- Built an SVM-classifier to classify patients in a sample dataset as at risk for heart disease
- Used a Grid Search cross-validation to identify optimal hyperparameters for the classifier
- Packages: tidyverse, caret, e1071, etc.
- Skills: SVM, grid search
