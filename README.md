## Past/Closed Projects
###  Project 1: Wine Quality 
Final Project Submission for Statistical Machine Learning (STAT 627) at American University   
[**Report**](https://github.com/Lspoletini/WineHearts/blob/main/R/WineQuality.pdf)   
[**RMarkdown File**](https://github.com/Lspoletini/WineHearts/blob/main/R/WineQuality.Rmd)  
[**Repository**](https://github.com/Lspoletini/WineHearts)  

#### Description
- Compared ordinal logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression, and linear regression for predicting wine quality with a dataset of chemical indicators.
- Reduced dimensionality using Principal Components, tuned via cross-validation with different cost functions.
- Language: R
- *Packages: tidyverse, ggplot, glmnet, e1071, nnet, others*
- *Skills: regression, parameter tuning, dimensionality reduction*

### Project 2: Heart Disease Classifier 
Final Project Submission for Statistical Machine Learning (STAT 627) at American University   
[**Report**](https://github.com/Lspoletini/WineHearts/blob/main/HeartDisease.pdf)  
[**RMarkdown File**](https://github.com/Lspoletini/WineHearts/blob/main/HeartDisease.Rmd)  
[**Repository**](https://github.com/Lspoletini/WineHearts)

##### Description
- Built and compared SVM and random forest models for classifying patients at risk for heart disease.
- Used a Grid Search cross-validation to identify optimal hyperparameters for each classifier.
- Contextualized results relating to clinical usefulness.
- *Packages: tidyverse, caret, e1071, randomForest, others*
- *Skills: SVM, grid search, Random Forest*

### Project 3: Marketing Dashboard
Final Project Submission for Business Intelligence (ITEC 660) at American University  
[**Slide Deck**](https://github.com/Lspoletini/MarketingDashboard/blob/main/FinalPresentationTeam3-2.pdf)  
[**R File**](https://github.com/Lspoletini/MarketingDashboard/blob/main/LogRegITEC660.R)  

##### Description
- Organized and cleaned a large (>50,000 leads) database of marketing data from American University's graduate school admissions office.
- Evaluated organic and paid marketing channels in terms of lead generation, conversion, and quality.
- Produced a Tableau dashboard summarizing long term trends, recent trends, and performance relative to KPIs.
- Used logistic regression to assess lead quality and applicant strength.
- *Packages: tidyverse* 
- *Skills: logistic regression, dashboards, teamwork, presentation skills*

### Project 4: fMRI Sex Classifier
Poster submission to OHBM (Organization of Human Brain Mapping) 2021, and honors thesis for Biomedical Engineering Honors Program at Vanderbilt University  
[**Report**](https://github.com/Lspoletini/SexClassifier/blob/main/BMEHonorsLiamSpoletini.pdf)   
[**Poster**](https://github.com/Lspoletini/SexClassifier/blob/main/SexModels_poster_v4.pdf)   

##### Description:
- Compared preprocessing pipelines for handling data from the [Young-Adult Human Connectome Project (HCP)](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult)
- Extracted features from fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) data pertaining to temporal complexity, including sample entropy and fALFF (fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations).
- Used these novel features to perform out-of-sample prediction of patient sex on unlabeled data, achieving prediction accuracy (84%) on par with contemporary literature on the subject.
- *Packages: keras, scikit-learn, numpy, etc.*
- *Skills: support vector machines, logistic regression, neural networks, academic writing*


Note: Apologies to anyone looking for the scripts from this project,  it is on an old machine that I do not have access to at the moment.
