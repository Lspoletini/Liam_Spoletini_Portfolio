### Description
- Compared ordinal logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression, and linear regression for predicting wine quality with a dataset of chemical indicators.
- Reduced dimensionality using Principal Components, tuned via cross-validation with different cost functions.
- Language: R
- *Packages: tidyverse, ggplot, glmnet, e1071, nnet, others*
- *Skills: regression, parameter tuning, dimensionality reduction*

## Project 2: Heart Disease Classifier [[Repo link]](https://github.com/Lspoletini/WineHearts)
Final Project Submission for Statistical Machine Learning (STAT 627) at American University   
[**Report**](https://github.com/Lspoletini/WineHearts/blob/main/HeartDisease.pdf)  
[**RMarkdown File**](https://github.com/Lspoletini/WineHearts/blob/main/HeartDisease.Rmd)  

#### Description
- Built and compared SVM and random forest models for classifying patients at risk for heart disease.
- Used a Grid Search cross-validation to identify optimal hyperparameters for each classifier.
- Contextualized results relating to clinical usefulness.
- *Packages: tidyverse, caret, e1071, randomForest, others*
- *Skills: SVM, grid search, Random Forest*
